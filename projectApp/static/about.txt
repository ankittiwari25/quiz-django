Paragraph Line is a journal of absurdist and outsider fiction, culture blogging, and cough syrup abuse instructional videos. Great emphasis is placed on not publishing “the usual”.

                We publish regularly online, and have published a “best of” print (and ebook) anthology. We’re privately funded, and not affiliated with any school or writing program, which means we’re not following the same old stodgy formula as traditional journals.
                
                In addition to PL, we publish other books, too. Check out our Books page to see our entire catalog, along with information on where to buy and how to download titles for free.
                
                This started in 1996 with Air in the Paragraph Line, a zine produced by Jon Konrath as a newsletter to document his writing exploits and mail to his friends. After six issues and an extended hiatus, the format expanded in 2005 to a small literary journal of writing by Konrath and several other writers. He published work he enjoyed reading, the kind of fiction and fact that kept him glued to the pages, in hopes that others would like it, too.
